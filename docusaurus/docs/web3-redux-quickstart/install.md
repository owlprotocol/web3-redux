# Install

Use your favorite node package manager to install `@owlprotocol/web3-redux` and the required peer dependencies. We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a disk space efficient drop-in replacement of npm.

```
pnpm install redux redux-saga react-redux web3 @owlprotocol/web3-redux
```
