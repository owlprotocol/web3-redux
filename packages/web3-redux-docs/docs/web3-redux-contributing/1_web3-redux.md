# Web3 Redux
This is the main Redux library that is meant to abstract state management regardless of the used UI Framework.

## Build
The project is built in Typescript and is transpiled to JS using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). When developing we recommend building in watch mode which you can do using the command below.

```bash
cd packages/web3-redux
npm run build:watch
```

## Project Layout
At the top level of our `packages/web3-redux/src/` folder we have the following directory structure. You'll notice these are mostly organized by data model, where each folder contains all the logic to process a specific type of blockchain data or API data.
Some important folders include:
* `crud/createCRUDModel.ts`: General CRUD model factory function, this is the base for all data models for generic `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations. Creates basic actions, sagas, hooks, and selectors used by all data models.
* `db.ts`: Dexie.js IndexedDB persistent state
* `orm.ts`: Redux-Orm in-memory state
* `store.ts`: Redux store combing reducers, sagas, and other middleware

 â”— ðŸ“œstore.ts   #default redux store and redux store factory functions, compose with custom reducers to integrate web3-redux to existing store
```

### Data Models
Most of the model directories (block, transaction, contract...) then have the following structure:
```bash
ðŸ“¦<model>
 â”£ ðŸ“‚actions    #Custom Redux actions
 â”£ ðŸ“‚hooks      #Custom React hooks
 â”£ ðŸ“‚middleware #Redux middleware
 â”£ ðŸ“‚model      #Define the model interface and any other utilities such as validation
    â”£ðŸ“œinterface.ts #Define model interface, Dexie indices
    â”£ðŸ“œorm.ts       #Define Redux-ORM Class
    â”—ðŸ“œvalidate.ts  #Define validation logic (sometimes included in interface.ts)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚sagas      #Custom Sagas (eg. RPC requests)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚selectors  #Custom Redux selectors
 â”£ ðŸ“œcrud.ts    #Basic CRUD model created using factory createCRUDModel()
 â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts   #Export all modules (actions, sagas, hooks, selectors)
```

## Test
We use the following libraries for testing:

-   [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) As a testing framework. Our `.mocharc.json` file is configured to run tests in parallel on 8 processes.
-   [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) As an test assertion library

Common actions in the `before()` or `beforeEach()` step of test suites include:

-   Setting up the store
-   Dispatching actions to the store to populate with test data (eg. Configure Network)
-   Setting up a `ganache-core` test Web3 provider (test blockchain)
-   Deploying test smart contracts (eg. Deploy ERC20 contract)

When running tests we recommend the following best practices:

-   Run individual test files with `mocha lib/<path-to-file>`
-   Run tests with event logging middleware `LOG_REDUX_ACTIONS=1 mocha lib/<path-to-file>`
-   If a test files contains many unit tests consider temporarily skipping sum by refactoring them to use `it.skip('MyTest, () => ...)`. Mocha will the test description but won't execute the test.

**Testing Hooks**
`web3-redux` supports React hooks to simplify integration with React components. These are **NOT** required however, and other non-React projects can still integrate all of the other Redux-based features for state management (actions, sagas, selectors).
Testing React Hooks requires introducing additional libraries to simulate the DOM and how hooks update:

-   [mocha-jsdom](https://github.com/rstacruz/mocha-jsdom) to quickly configure JSDOM with Mocha.
-   [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/) to test render hooks
